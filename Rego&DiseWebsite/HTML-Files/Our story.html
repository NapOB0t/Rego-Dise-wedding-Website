            okay am I seeing this girl or is this
            your phone it's gonna tell me it's not
            meet her
        
            okay well we make it high school but
            yeah we met back in high school
            interesting story she arrived the
            squirrels in great Tim and she was now
            the new fresh visa call them credit and
            in she came with a flock of friends nice
            bunch of friends
            I doubt one of the friends and pursued
            one of the friends fortunately that with
            but later then when I was in the trick
            choosing
            no but yes yeah because you know okay I
            think I think after that but we we just
            started to chat a little bit but it
            wasn't until acosta up effect in the bus
            when one time I'm going to
            fancy some girl code
            so you'd want to break some girl code
            and I posted a picture on facebook
            Williams spdc now decided to actually
            check for like so that's when he saw me
            on Facebook and he decided to say hi to
            me and then we started talking and from
            like being spontaneous I don't know what
            it is I decided to say hey don't you
            know to go to the city you know just to
            meet each other
            I just told them with my friend so let
            me get to go to city if we get the and
            my mom is waiting my mom and I were
            wasted by the tickets section mmm and
            then so now we're waiting for DC to
            arrive so if I woke because I it's a guy
            so here I am
            you know I know
            okay thank you
            vitality for helping us like being
            friends again after to know each other
            there was a little hiccup because I was
            in the process of becoming a pilot so
            then and I had to move away to go live
            in Eastern Cape so now that little
            figure you know telling piece of eight
            to say are you prepared or to stay with
            you for such a long time
            are you able to do the wrong place you
            did the long distance relationship then
            literally almost didn't make us we went
            through the finest
            what hardships you will
            so yes because I mean I prayed for her
            you know having so many girls dating
            when I when I decided you know at this
            time I need to find somebody I said lord
            please please bless me with a woman that
            just turns into you and it's full force
            for you
            and it actually the same story before we
            even talked to me on Facebook in 2011 I
            remember I was going through a stage and
            I prayed and I asked God and I'm like
            God please the next man that I'm gonna
            date hit me please be a man who's
            god-fearing yeah who loves you who could
            help me spiritually grow and get me
            closer to you help me through that
            process and you always be there in our
            relationship so it's it's amazing how we
            both prayed it even started and God
            answered and shoulders within the
            evidence so if we move yes we are so
            blown away that we recognize this yeah
            it's almost coincidental but you want to
            say define the intervention of God being
            the center of our relationship yes think
            about Union yeah so basically every
            single time we see a refugee say it
            means to us that God must help us grow
            continuously grow in our relationship
            yes so internally and subscribe man so
            god please help us grow and continue to
            grow so now that we are embarking on
            another journey now it's beyond me I'm
            our journey together the grace of God
            let God continue to do with us that's
            how we met story.
